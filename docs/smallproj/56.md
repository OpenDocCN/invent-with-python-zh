强力球彩票是一种令人兴奋的小额输钱方式。如果你购买一张 2 美元的彩票，你可以选择六个号码:从 1 到 69 中抽取五个，从 1 到 26 中抽取第六个“强力球”号码。数字的顺序并不重要。如果彩票选择了你的六个号码，你将赢得 15.86 亿美元！除了你不会赢，因为你的赔率是 292201338 分之一。但是如果你花 200 美元买了 100 张票，你的胜算是。。。2922013 分之一。你也不会赢，但至少你会损失 100 倍的钱。越喜欢输钱，彩票越好玩！

为了帮助你想象你中不了彩票的几率，这个程序模拟了多达一百万个强力球抽奖，然后将它们与你挑选的数字进行比较。现在你可以不用花钱就能享受彩票中奖的所有刺激。

有趣的事实:每一组六个数字都和其他数字一样有可能赢。所以下次你想买彩票的时候，选 1、2、3、4、5 和 6。这些数字很可能会以更复杂的形式出现。

## 行动中的计划

当您运行`powerballottery.py`时，输出将如下所示:

Powerball Lottery, by Al Sweigart email@protected

Each powerball lottery ticket costs $2\. The jackpot for this game
is $1.586 billion! It doesn't matter what the jackpot is, though,
because the odds are 1 in 292,201,338, so you won't win.

This simulation gives you the thrill of playing without wasting money.

Enter 5 different numbers from 1 to 69, with spaces between
each number. (For example: 5 17 23 42 50 51)
> 1 2 3 4 5
Enter the powerball number from 1 to 26.
> 6
How many times do you want to play? (Max: 1000000)
> 1000000
It costs $2000000 to play 1000000 times, but don't
worry. I'm sure you'll win it all back.
Press Enter to start...
The winning numbers are: 12 29 48 11 4 and 13  You lost.
The winning numbers are: 54 39 3 42 16 and 12  You lost.
The winning numbers are: 56 4 63 23 38 and 24  You lost.
`--snip--`
The winning numbers are: 46 29 10 62 17 and 21 You lost.
The winning numbers are: 5 20 18 65 30 and 10  You lost.
The winning numbers are: 54 30 58 10 1 and 18  You lost.
You have wasted $2000000
Thanks for playing!
```

## 它是如何工作的

这个程序的输出看起来相当一致，因为第 109 行的`allWinningNums.ljust(21)`代码用足够的空间填充数字，占据 21 列，不管中奖数字有多少位。这使得“你输了。”文本总是出现在屏幕的同一个地方，所以即使程序快速输出几行，它仍然是可读的。

## 探索计划

试着找出下列问题的答案。尝试对代码进行一些修改，然后重新运行程序，看看这些修改有什么影响。

1.  如果把 100 行的`possibleNumbers[0:5]`改成`numbers`，101 行的`random.randint(1, 26)`改成`powerball`，会发生什么？
2.  如果删除或注释掉第 96 行的`possibleNumbers = list(range(1, 70))`，会得到什么错误？
