21 点，也称为 21 点，是一种纸牌游戏，玩家试图在不超过 21 点的情况下尽可能接近 21 点。这个程序使用用文本字符绘制的图像，称为 *ASCII 艺术画*。美国信息交换标准码(ASCII)是 Unicode 取代之前计算机使用的文本字符到数字代码的映射。本程序中的扑克牌是 ASCII 艺术的一个例子:

```py
 ___   ___
|A  | |10 |
| ♣ | | ♦ |
|__A| |_10|
```

你可以在[`en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack)找到其他规则和这个纸牌游戏的历史。

## 运行示例

当您运行 `blackjack.py` 时，输出将如下所示:

    Rules:
      Try to get as close to 21 without going over.
      Kings, Queens, and Jacks are worth 10 points.
      Aces are worth 1 or 11 points.
      Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
      (H)it to take another card.
      (S)tand to stop taking cards.
      On your first play, you can (D)ouble down to increase your bet
      but must hit exactly one more time before standing.
      In case of a tie, the bet is returned to the player.
      The dealer stops hitting at 17.
Money: 5000
How much do you bet? (1-5000, or QUIT)
> 400
Bet: 400

DEALER: ???

## 工作原理

你的键盘上没有牌组符号，这就是为什么我们调用`chr()`函数来创建它们。传递给`chr()`的整数被称为 Unicode *码位*，这是根据 Unicode 标准标识字符的唯一数字。Unicode 经常被误解。然而，Ned Batchelder 的 2012 年 PyCon US talk“实用 Unicode，或者我如何停止痛苦？”是对 Unicode 的极好介绍，您可以在`youtu.be/sgHbC6udIqc`找到它。附录 B 给出了可以在 Python 程序中使用的 Unicode 字符的完整列表。

在输入源代码并运行几次之后，尝试对其进行实验性的修改。21 点有几个自定义规则，你可以实施。例如，如果前两张牌的价值相同，玩家可以将它们分成两只手，分别下注。此外，如果玩家的前两张牌中有一张“21 点”(黑桃 a 和 21 点)，玩家将赢得十比一的奖金。你可以从`en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack`那里找到更多关于这个游戏的信息。

## 探索程序

试着找出下列问题的答案。尝试对代码进行一些修改，然后重新运行程序，看看这些修改有什么影响。

1.  你如何让玩家以不同的金额开始游戏？
2.  该计划如何防止玩家下注超过他们的钱？
3.  程序如何表示单卡？
4.  该程序如何表示一手牌？
5.  `rows`列表中的每个字符串(在第 197 行创建)代表什么？
6.  如果删除或注释掉第 148 行的`random.shuffle(deck)`会发生什么？
7.  如果把 112 行的`money -= bet`改成`money += bet`会怎么样？
8.  当`displayHands()`功能中的`showDealerHand`设置为`True`时会发生什么？到了`False`会怎么样？
