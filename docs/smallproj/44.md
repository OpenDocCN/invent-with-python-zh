棋盘游戏曼卡拉至少有 2000 年的历史，几乎和 63 号项目“乌尔的皇家游戏”一样古老这是一种“播种”游戏，两名玩家选择几袋种子，撒在棋盘上的其他口袋里，同时尽可能多地收集他们商店里的种子。在不同的文化中，这种游戏有几种变体。这个名字来自阿拉伯语 `naqala` ，意思是“移动”

玩的时候，从你这边的一个坑里抓种子，然后在每个坑里放一个，逆时针方向走，跳过你对手的仓库。如果你的最后一粒种子落在你的一个空坑里，将对面坑的种子移到那个坑里。如果最后放置的种子在你的商店里，你有一次免费机会。

当一个玩家的所有坑都空了时，游戏结束。另一名玩家声称剩余的种子属于他们的商店，获胜者是拥有最多种子的人。更多关于曼卡拉及其变种的信息可以在[`en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala)找到。

## 运行示例

当您运行 `mancala.py` 时，输出将如下所示:

## 工作原理

Mancala 使用 ASCII 艺术来显示棋盘。请注意，每个口袋不仅需要有种子的数量，还需要有一个标签。为了避免混淆，标签上使用了从`A`到`L`的字母，这样就不会被误认为是每个口袋里的种子数量。字典`NEXT_PIT`和`OPPOSITE_PIT`分别将一个口袋的字母映射到它旁边或对面的坑的字母。这使得表达式`NEXT_PIT['A']`计算为`'B'`，表达式`OPPOSITE_PIT['A']`计算为`'G'`。注意代码是如何使用这些字典的。没有它们，我们的 Mancala 程序将需要一长串的`if`和`elif`语句来执行相同的游戏步骤。

The ancient two-player, seed-sowing game. Grab the seeds from a pit on
your side and place one in each following pit, going counterclockwise
and skipping your opponent's store. If your last seed lands in an empty
pit of yours, move the opposite pit's seeds into your store. The
goal is to get the most seeds in your store on the side of the board.
If the last placed seed is in your store, you get a free turn.

The game ends when all of one player's pits are empty. The other player
claims the remaining seeds for their store, and the winner is the one
with the most seeds.

在输入源代码并运行几次之后，尝试对其进行实验性的修改。你也可以自己想办法做到以下几点:

*   换个板多点坑。
*   随机选择一个奖励坑，当最后一粒种子落在坑中时，让玩家进行另一轮游戏。
*   为四个玩家而不是两个玩家创建一个正方形的棋盘。

## 探索程序

试着找出下列问题的答案。尝试对代码进行一些修改，然后重新运行程序，看看这些修改有什么影响。

1.  如果把 175 行的`return '2'`改成`return '1'`会怎么样？
2.  如果把 208 行的`return '2'`改成`return '1'`会怎么样？
3.  如果把 125 行的`response == 'QUIT'`改成`response == 'quit'`会怎么样？
4.  如果把 147 行的`board[pit] = 0`改成`board[pit] = 1`会怎么样？
5.  如果把 53 行的`print('\n' * 60)`改成`print('\n' * 0)`会怎么样？
6.  如果把第 48 行的`playerTurn = '1'`改成`playerTurn = '2'`会怎么样？
7.  如果把 135 行的`board.get(response) == 0`改成`board.get(response) == -1`会怎么样？
