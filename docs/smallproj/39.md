# 三十八、我控诉

你就是举世闻名的大侦探玛蒂尔德·加缪。猫佐菲不见了，你必须筛选线索。嫌疑人要么总是说谎，要么总是说真话。你会及时找到猫佐菲并指控有罪的一方吗？

在这个游戏中，你乘出租车到城市的不同地点。每个地方都有一个嫌疑犯和一件物品。可以向嫌疑人询问其他嫌疑人和物品的情况，将他们的回答与自己的探索笔记进行对比，确定他们是在说谎还是在说真话。有些人会知道谁绑架了佐菲(或者她在哪里，或者在绑架者的位置发现了什么物品)，但是你必须确定你是否能相信他们。你有五分钟时间找到罪犯，但是如果你三次指控错误，你就输了。这款游戏的灵感来源于 Homestar Runner 的“鸡蛋在哪里？”游戏。

## 运行示例

当您运行 `jaccuse.py` 时，输出将如下所示:

```py
J'ACCUSE! (a mystery game)
`--snip--`
Time left: 5 min, 0 sec
  You are in your TAXI. Where do you want to go?
(A)LBINO ALLIGATOR PIT
(B)OWLING ALLEY
(C)ITY HALL
(D)UCK POND
(H)IPSTER CAFE
(O)LD BARN
(U)NIVERSITY LIBRARY
(V)IDEO GAME MUSEUM
(Z)OO
> a

Time left: 4 min, 48 sec
  You are at the ALBINO ALLIGATOR PIT.
  ESPRESSA TOFFEEPOT with the ONE COWBOY BOOT is here.

(J) "J'ACCUSE!" (3 accusations left)
(Z) Ask if they know where ZOPHIE THE CAT is.
(T) Go back to the TAXI.
(1) Ask about ESPRESSA TOFFEEPOT
(2) Ask about ONE COWBOY BOOT
> z
  They give you this clue: "DUKE HAUTDOG"
Press Enter to continue...
`--snip--`
```

## 工作原理

要完全理解这个程序，您应该密切关注`clues`字典，它位于第 51 行到第 109 行。您可以取消对第 151 到 154 行的注释，以便在屏幕上显示它。这个字典有来自`SUSPECTS`列表的字符串作为键，有“线索字典”作为值。每个线索字典都包含来自`SUSPECTS`和`ITEMS`的字符串。当被问及另一个嫌疑人或物品时，最初的嫌疑人会用这些字符串回答。例如，如果`clues['DUKE HAUTDOG']['CANDLESTICK']`设定为`'DUCK POND'`，那么当玩家向杜克·豪特多格询问烛台时，他们会说它在鸭塘。每次玩游戏时，嫌疑人、物品、地点和罪犯都会被洗牌。

这个程序的代码围绕着这个数据结构，所以理解它对于理解程序的其余部分是必要的。

Inspired by Homestar Runner\'s "Where\'s an Egg?" game

You are the world-famous detective, Mathilde Camus.
ZOPHIE THE CAT has gone missing, and you must sift through the clues.
Suspects either always tell lies, or always tell the truth. Ask them
about other people, places, and items to see if the details they give are
truthful and consistent with your observations. Then you will know if
their clue about ZOPHIE THE CAT is true or not. Will you find ZOPHIE THE
CAT in time and accuse the guilty party?

## 探索程序

试着找出下列问题的答案。尝试对代码进行一些修改，然后重新运行程序，看看这些修改有什么影响。

1.  如果把第 16 行的`TIME_TO_SOLVE = 300`改成`TIME_TO_SOLVE = 0`会怎么样？
2.  如果把 176 行的`time.time() > endTime or accusationsLeft == 0`改成`time.time() > endTime and accusationsLeft == 0`会怎么样？
3.  如果把 198 行的`place[1:]`改成`place`会怎么样？
4.  如果把 173 行的`startTime + TIME_TO_SOLVE`改成`startTime * TIME_TO_SOLVE`会怎么样？
