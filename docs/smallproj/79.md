一块黄色的石头扔进蓝色的池塘会变成什么？英国有 7 月 4 日吗？医生怎么能 30 天不睡觉？不管你认为这些问题的答案是什么，你可能都错了。这个项目中的 54 个问题都是经过精心设计的，因此它们的答案简单、明显且容易误导人。找到真正的答案需要一些小聪明。

复制这本书的代码会破坏乐趣，因为你会看到答案，所以你可能想在看源代码之前下载并玩这个来自[`inventwithpython.com/trickquestions.py`](https://inventwithpython.com/trickquestions.py)的游戏。

## 行动中的计划

当您运行 `trickquestions.py` 时，输出将如下所示:

## 它是如何工作的

`QUESTIONS`变量保存一个字典列表。每个字典代表一个单独的难题，并且有关键字`'question'`、`'answer'`和`'accept'`。`'question'`和`'answer'`的值分别是程序向玩家提出问题并给出答案时显示的字符串。`'accept'`键的值是一个字符串列表。如果玩家输入包含任何这些字符串的响应，它将被认为是正确的。这允许玩家输入自由格式的文本作为回复。该程序在检测他们何时提供了正确答案方面相当准确。
